# GuessWho
Customer Problem:
  Children might feel bored when they think that the work or activity they are doing is not challenging. 
  So, they need to be provided with activities which they feel very exciting and challenging. 
  Chatbots are a great way to bring characters to life, they’re a natural fit for designing compelling experiences for children. 
  Since our chatbot is targeting a child audience, it’s essential that our bot is lifelike and believable in all aspects.

Proposed Solution:
  Our Bot is going to guess what the kid is thinking in his/her mind. 
  This is done by asking the kid a few questions. 
  In this, the kid has to think about a character and then start the game. 
  After that our bot will ask them some questions and then guesses the answer based on the input given by them.
